At the top of every page you’ll see the same navigation bar—that’s because each PHP template pulls in a shared `nav.inc.php` file. That include holds all of your main links (Home, About, Resume, Labs, Projects, plus GitHub and LinkedIn), and it even knows whether you’re logged in or not. If you are, it switches “Login” to “Logout” and, for admins, shows a “Manage Labs” link.

Under the hood, when you click “Login,” a little pop‑up form appears (your login modal). You enter your username and password, the browser sends that information to `login.php` behind the scenes, and if it checks out you simply reload the page to see that “Login” has turned into “Logout.” Non‑admins can’t reach the lab‑management page—if they try, they get sent back home.

Each content page follows a similar pattern: it first starts your session, then prints the HTML header (with CSS and fonts), then prints the shared navigation, and finally outputs its own unique section. For example, the Projects page asks the database for all of your projects, then loops through them and shows each one as a little card (complete with icon, title, description, and “View Project” link). The Labs page shows a form for adding new labs and a table of existing ones—admins can click the trash icon to delete any lab instantly via AJAX. All of your colors, fonts, and layouts live in one central stylesheet so everything stays consistent, and you’ve got special light‑background rules for pages like Resume and About Me, which are meant to look more like printable documents.

With this setup, adding a new page is as easy as creating a new template that includes your shared header/navigation/footer, writing the page’s unique HTML, and—if you need it—writing a simple database query or AJAX handler. Everything stays in the same familiar structure, making the site easy to update and expand.
