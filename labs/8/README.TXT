notes to self:
*** don't forget 1-2 spaces for tab indenting -- will lose points!!!
*** don't forget to use different variable names other than the sample ones -- will lose points!!!

--> in plotka's example JSON, use diff variable names
--> make in relation to the html file

hello mr ola, have a great day!
