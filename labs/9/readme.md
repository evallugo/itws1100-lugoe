I tried my best. This lab gave me so many problems, especially with GitHub and stashed changes. I hated every bit of this. Please be merciful because this was so bad. Github was giving me so many issues so I don't even know what is going on but it works on my website. I can't tell if thisis from before but I have changed my code. This lab is cursed and so bad. It ruins my GitHub ane permissions.
